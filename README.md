# SQL-InfoSchema-App
ASP.NET Core MVC application that will help you formulate SQL select queries and store them in a database table for runtime use by your application(s).
Unique interface is built by reading the SQL InformationSchema to determine tables and relationships. Sample code, generated by the app, shows how to implement a stored query in a Web API controller. 

** **CODE HAS NOT BEEN UPLOADED JUST YET.. WILL BE VERY SOON**

### Pick a Table

Related tables are automatically selected and will be included in your query. Don't worry, you can deselect them on the next page.

![InfoView](infoview.png?raw=true)

### Tweak and Save the Generated Query

Sample data is queried from your database to make it easy to include just what you need for the query.

![QueryView](queryview.png?raw=true)

### See The Code

The cloned solution has a class library with several helpful classes. This example shows how the QueryBuilder class (from .Net Controller) can be used to surface your query in a client application.
