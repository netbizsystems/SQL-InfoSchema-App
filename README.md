# SQL-InfoSchema-App
ASP.NET Core MVC application that will help you formulate SQL select queries and store them in a database table for later runtime use by your application(s).
Unique interface is built by reading the SQL InformationSchema to determine tables and relationships. Sample code, generated by the app, shows how to implement a stored query in a Web API controller.

### Pick a Table

Related tables are automatically selected and will be included in your query. Don't worry, you can deselect them on the next page.

![InfoView](infoview.png?raw=true)

### Tweak and Save the Generated Query

Sample data is queried from your database to make it easy to include just what you need for the query. Click SAVE to save your query to the SQL query store (table).

![QueryView](queryview.png?raw=true)

### See The Code

The cloned solution has a class library with several helpful classes to work with your query. This example shows how the *QueryRunnerController* class (from .Net Controller) can be used to surface your query in a client application.

## setup requirements

**appsettings.json** - requires two connection strings, one for the app meta-data and the other being the database that you are writing queries against. The SQL/DDL script for the meta-data tables can be found in the **Solution Items** folder.
```
